<h1>Travel Mapping Manual: System Highway Lists</h1>

<div class="text">Each highway system needs to have files that list basic 
information about each route that is part of the system. The Chopped 
Routes File (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/TravelMapping/HighwayData/blob/master/hwy_data/_systems/usai.csv"><code>usai.csv</code></a>)
tells our scripts which files to look for and to load into the web site. The Connected Routes File (e.g., 
<a href="https://github.com/TravelMapping/HighwayData/blob/master/hwy_data/_systems/usai_con.csv"><code>usai_con.csv</code></a>)
lists how those chopped routes are connected across boundaries to make full-length routes.</div>

Creating the files</p>

<div class="text">
<ul>
  <li><a name="csvfile"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#csvfile">&#x1f517</a>
  Make a text file with comma-separated values containing all the needed info for each of these files.
  Use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text editor</a> or a spreadsheet program such as
  <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">OpenOffice Calc</a> (it's free).
  Then save the file with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"><code>.csv</code></a> filename extention.</li>
  <li><a name="csvsemicolon"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#csvsemicolon">&#x1f517</a>
  Use a semicolon (not a comma!) as the field delimiter, and don't 
  use any text delimiters (no quotes!). In OpenOffice Calc, the default 
  delimiters are comma and double quotes, but instead you must specify 
  semicolons and none for the two types. Saving in UTF-8 encoding is necessary to ensure that international characters are properly handled.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a name="csvoo"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#csvoo">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>In OpenOffice Calc, the three correct options when saving 
    the sheet as a <code>.csv</code> file are: UTF-8 encoding, semicolon delimiter, no 
    text delimiter. </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <li><a name="csvexcel"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#csvexcel">&#x1f517</a>
  Excel doesn't cooperate with UTF-8 encoding and will not use semicolon delimiters when saving a <code>.csv</code> file. 
  It will save the file using commas. This is not good. You could do a search
  and replace on the <code>.csv</code> file to turn the commas into semicolons, but 
  beware: sometimes commas are part of the City and Roots fields.</br>
  <b>Best advice: Don't use Excel but download and use OpenOffice Calc or use a text editor.</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="subheading"><a name="chopped"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#chopped">&#x1f517</a>
Chopped Routes File (e.g., <code>usai.csv</code>) format</p>

<div class="text">
<ul>
  <li><a name="spreatsheet"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#spreatsheet">&#x1f517</a>
  Make a <code>.csv</code> file with the name <code>systemcode.csv</code>. Replace <code>systemcode</code>
  with the lowercase <a href="sysnew.php#developsystem">system code assigned to your system</a>. E.g., the 
  spreadsheet for the Ohio State Highways (system code = <code>usaoh</code>) is <code>usaoh.csv</code>.</li>
  <li><a name="header"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#header">&#x1f517</a>
  The spreadsheet must have 8 columns and 1 header row. Use the 
  header row to label the columns, not to enter the first highway. In 
  processing, the first row is always ignored.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="columns"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#columns">&#x1f517</a>
  The columns:</li>
  <ol>
    <li><a name="csystem"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#csystem">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>System</strong>: the short, all-lowercase system code 
    for the system. It should appear in every row 
    of the spreadsheet even though it seems redundant. It is also used for 
    the filename above.</li>
    <li><a name="cregion"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#cregion">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>Region</strong>:
    For undivided countries, this is the uppercase 3-letter country abbreviation in which the highway is located.
    Country subdivision codes are used instead or in addition for divided countries as <a href="hwydata.php#region">
    used in the <code>.wpt</code> file name</a> but all-uppercase and with hyphen (no spaces),
    e.g. <code>FL</code> for Florida, <code>NT</code> for Northwest Territories,
    <code>DEU-TH</code> for Thuringia, <code>ESP-AR for</code> for Aragon, <code>MEX-BC</code> for Baja California.</li>
    <li><a name="croute"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#croute">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>Route</strong>: The name of the highway, ignoring any banners or qualifiers. No spaces! <code>US34</code> for US 34,
    <code>OH17</code> for OH 17, <code>PA66</code> for Business PA 66, <code>A7</code>
    for French Autoroute A7. Skip hyphens and slashes unless they separate 
    two numbers (M22-1), or the hyphen is in common usage such as for US Interstates or Business Interstates (I-80BL)
    and Quebec Autoroutes (A-50). For routes with names instead of numbered designations, follow the same rules for <a href="wayptlabels.php#truncate">truncating highway names</a> used when labeling waypoints.</li>
    <li><a name="cbanner"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#cbanner">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>Banner</strong>: For bannered routes, put the 3-letter banner abbreviation(s) <a href="hwydata.php#banner">
    used in the <code>.wpt</code> file name but starting with an uppercase letter</a> (<code>Bus</code>, <code>Alt</code>, <code>Spr</code>, etc.)
    here only if needed. Otherwise leave it completely blank (no whitespace). <code>Lp</code> for Loop is two letters. No more than six characters
    (for double-bannered routes) are allowed.</li>
    <li><a name="cabbrev"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#cabbrev">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>Abbreviation</strong>: The three-letter abbreviation for auxiliary highways or for most piecemeal highways
    if needed to distinguish between otherwise identically named routes of the same highway in the same region.
    <code>Pit</code> for Truck US 19 (Pittsburgh). Otherwise leave it blank (no whitespace).</li>
    <li><a name="ccity"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#ccity">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>City</strong>: Used to distinguish between otherwise identically named routes of the same highway in the same region.
    <code>Pittsburgh</code> for Truck US 19 (Pittsburgh).
    Prefer using city names (if applicable) or other common geographical names to distinguish, e.g. island names.
    This is the text that will appear below 
    the shield in the highway browser. Usually no text is needed except for 
    auxiliary highways, so leave it blank (no whitespace) in most cases. The
    name should be spelled as the locals spell it and using international 
    characters as needed.
    <ul>
      <li><a name="ccity_discontinuous"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#ccity_discontinuous">&#x1f517</a>
      <b>If there are two or more discontinuous routes of the same 
      Route+Banner combination, each wholly within the same, single region</b>, 
      use either "(Main)" (parentheses included) for the longer route
      or give this piece a city name.  For example, if there are 200-mile and 8-mile
      disconnected sections of US 47 in the same state, use "(Main)" or a
      geographical name for the long section and a geographical name for the short section.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><a name="croot"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#croot">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>Filename root:</strong> The <a href="hwydata.php#regionroute">name of the <code>.wpt</code> file<a> with the extension omitted.
    <code>pa.us019trkpit</code>, <code>oh.oh007</code>, etc.</li>
    <li><a name="caltroute"></a><a style="text-decoration:none" href="#caltroute">&#x1f517</a>
    <strong>Alt Route Names</strong> A comma-separated list of 
    deprecated route names, or blank if none.  This field is blank for most 
    routes and not blank only when necessary to handle route merges or name 
    changes.  While the primary route name is usually split into the Route, 
    Banner, and Abbrev columns, any alt route names have these 3 parts 
    concatenated. The result should be whatever would be entered in a <code>.list</code> file for the old name of the route, e.g. I-22FutTup.</li>

    <b>Name:</b> like the <a href="#ccity">City field of the Chopped Routes File</a>, the 
    Name field is used to distinguish between otherwise identically named

      region names separated by space-hyphen-space.  Put the region names in 
      the usual order for the system (e.g., region containing the southern or 
      western end first if in the US).  For example, the northern US 9 spans 
      New Jersey and New York in that order, so the Name should be "New Jersey

      add an abbreviated direction (NW., W., C., etc.) to that region name in
      each Name it appears.  For example, the western US 422 would be Named 
      "Ohio - W. Pennsylvania" and the eastern US 422 would be Named "E. 
      Pennsylvania".  Alternatively, if one route is wholly on a large island 
      within the region (of size like that of Crete or larger), use the island
      name along with the region abbreviation.  For example, E25 has a piece 
      "Netherlands - Italy" that includes mainland France, as well as pieces 
      in the large islands of Corsica, France, and Sardinia, Italy.  The three

  The System, Region, Route, Banner, Abbreviation, Filename Root, Alt Route Names and Roots

Example system: Takoma National H Routes (tach)</p>

<p class="text">Takoma is the country, and it has 3 states:<br />
NT - North Takoma<br />
CT - Central Takoma<br />
ST - South Takoma<br />
(Or Takoma could be some large area with these as 3 countries. It does not matter.)
</p>

<p class="text">The national H route system spans the 3 states with routes H1 - H4.</p>

<p class="text">Map:
<img src="tach_002.gif"></p>


<p class="text">H1 is in NT only.<br />
H2 passes through ST, CT, and NT.<br />
H3 has two parts, one spanning ST and CT, and the other in NT.<br />
H3 has a bannered Alt route around Capital City, CT.<br />
H4 has two parts, both in NT. The Springfield part is the main part, and the Shelbyville part is shorter.</p>

<p class="text">The chopped routes file tach.xls looks like this*:<br />
<img src="tach.gif">
</p>

<p class="text">It lists each highway once per region. This is the same format we've been using since 2009*.</p>

<p style="font-size:x-small;">*This section of the manual was written 
before the AltRouteNames column was added to the Chopped Routes files.  
The AltRouteNames column should be included in these files, even though 
these examples don't show it.</p>
<p class="text">The connected routes file tach_con.xls looks like this:<br />
<img src="tach_con.gif">
</p>

<p class="text">Each line represents one route in total rather than one in each 
region. The Roots column shows a list of the file root names that 
comprise that route, delimited by commas only and not also with spaces.</p>

<p class="text">The Name column takes on a role similar to the City column of the 
chopped routes file. It is a short amount of text to distinguish between
 routes with identical Route and Banner fields.</p>

<p class="text">The Region and Abbrev columns do not appear in the 
connected routes file because my scripts can look up this info from the 
chopped roots file by connecting the two files via the file roots. So 
this info is not repeated in the <code>.csv</code> files.</p>

<p class="text">Since H1 and H2 are unique after being connected across the boundaries, no Name is necessary.</p>

<p class="text">There are multiple H3's and H4's, so each piece gets a Name. The 
two-state H3 Name lists the states at its ends with a hyphen in between.
 If there were more states and it spanned more than two, only the two 
endpoint states would be the ones listed. The other H3 is within a 
single state, so that state is the Name.</p>

<p class="text">The two H4s are in the same region, so the Name is the main city that
 each serves, and in fact it is the City from the chopped routes file.</p>

<p class="text">The City for bannered routes like H3 Alt is mandatory in the chopped 
routes file, and the same city is used as the Name in the connected 
routes file.</p>

<p class="text">Many of our highway systems do not have highways spanning more than 
one region. For example, the Pennsylvania State Highways are completely 
within Pennsylvania. This means that all the rows of the connected 
routes file will have a single file root. The bannered routes like PA 8 
Truck and the duplicated routes like PA 29 and PA 97 will need Name 
fields.</p>

<p class="text">In some other systems, there are only a small number of routes that 
cross a border without changing designation. For example, the New York 
State Highways, has only NY 17 running into PA and NY 120A dipping into 
CT. Most rows of the connected routes file will have a single file root,
 but the row for NY 17 and the row for NY 120A will have a few roots 
separated by commas.</p>

<p class="text">In the major multi-region-spanning systems, like the I &amp; US 
highways in the US, the TCH in Canada, the M and A routes in Great 
Britain, and the Int'l E Roads, the rows of the connected routes file 
will vary greatly in the number of file roots listed.</p>
